## 📝 Key Insights (Summary)
- Search network drives most engagement compared to Display.
- Mobile contributes a large share of engagement vs desktop.
- A small number of campaigns consume most of the budget.
- Several keywords show high spend with low engagement and should be reviewed or added as negatives.
- Performance varies significantly by hour/day, useful for bid scheduling.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Conversions were not available at the campaign level in some datasets, so clicks were used as a proxy for performance.
- External factors (seasonality, landing page quality, pricing) are not included in the data.

2. Open in Power BI Desktop.
